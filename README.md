# Leap-year
## Specifications
1. The year should be divisible by 4.
2. If the year can be divisible by 100 it is not a leap year until it is also divisible by 400.
3. If a user offers a value to evaluate, he will need to test it against each of the leap year rules.
4. We will use behaviour driven development to generate examples of the rules individually.
5. We will also separate the User Jnterface from the Business Logic.
